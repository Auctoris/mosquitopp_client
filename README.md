# mosquitopp_client
A sample MQTT client built to use the mosquittopp library.

I was strugglign to find any complete example code for using the C++ bindings for the Mosquitto library on the web, so having got something working, I thought I'd share in case anyone else wanted to see how it works.

For more information about the Mosquitto broker see http://mosquitto.org 

This project needs mosquitto to be installed, and the broker running in order to work.
